Jon is currently seeking a¬†**senior or staff-level role**, ideally focused on frontend specialization but open to staff positions that include cross-functional leadership expectations if well supported, ideally starting at senior with the opportunity to grow. He wants to focus on¬†**frontend development**¬†within a¬†**small, cross-functional team**¬†where he can contribute meaningfully to the user experience and shared tooling.

He‚Äôs most excited by¬†**mission-driven companies**, especially in areas like¬†**EdTech, creativity support tools**, and any product that tangibly improves people‚Äôs lives or supports human potential. He has a strong track record in educational software and is drawn to roles that further collective well-being or capability.

While he prefers a¬†**full-time role**, Jon is also open to¬†**freelance or contract work**¬†if it‚Äôs aligned with his interests and skills. He is based in the¬†**Salt Lake City area**¬†and open to¬†**local or fully remote opportunities**.

His top priorities when choosing a role include:

- Alignment with the company‚Äôs mission and values
- Healthy team culture and collaborative work style
- Remote or hybrid flexibility
- Fair and competitive compensation

#### üß≠ Preferred Work Style & Ideal Role

Jon thrives in small, cross-functional teams‚Äîespecially where he can maintain a mix of autonomy and collaboration. While he enjoys the communication bandwidth of in-person work, remote flexibility is important for managing parenting responsibilities and his unique daily rhythm. A hybrid setup might be ideal, but he‚Äôs proven successful in fully remote and in-office roles alike.

He prefers focused work blocks with minimal interruptions, allowing for deep concentration and creative problem solving. Asynchronous communication styles work well for him when paired with thoughtful documentation and clear goals.

Jon‚Äôs best fit is in hands-on frontend development, especially when he has ownership over architecture, shared libraries, and UI component design. He values roles where he can build tools that delight both users and fellow engineers, and enjoys mentoring junior developers as part of that process. He is open to leadership roles if they‚Äôre collaborative and well-supported, but his core passion is thoughtful, impactful building.

What Jon actively avoids:

- **DevOps/SRE roles**: While he respects these disciplines and collaborates well with them, on-call rotations and infrastructure stress are not aligned with his strengths or passions.
- **Backend-only roles**: Jon values full-stack understanding but needs front-end work to feel fulfilled and creatively engaged.

#### ü§ù Team Collaboration Style

Jon thrives in smaller teams where he can have meaningful impact and a measure of autonomy. He‚Äôs worked in both structured agile environments and looser, more exploratory settings, and has succeeded in both. He values working closely with product managers, designers, and QA‚Äîviewing their feedback and perspectives as essential to doing his best work. He regularly checks in with stakeholders during implementation to ensure alignment and is always appreciative of bugs or issues QA identifies.

When it comes to feedback, Jon leads with empathy and specificity. He believes in giving meaningful positive feedback often, and offers constructive critique with care and clarity. When receiving feedback, he remains open and reflective, even when he doesn‚Äôt fully agree.

Jon enjoys mentorship and knowledge sharing and has delivered several technical presentations in past roles. However, he strongly prefers to work independently rather than through pair programming, finding his best flow in solo thought. He remains open to collaboration but values space for focus.

Key values that guide his collaboration include:

- **Clarity:**¬†Communication deserves attention. Clear writing and repeated framing are often more powerful than complex coordination.
- **Documentation:**¬†Shared codebases live or die by their docs. Jon writes documentation that enables reuse and onboarding.
- **Empathy & Curiosity:**¬†He assumes good intent and seeks to understand root causes rather than jumping to conclusions.

#### üå± Professional Values & Guiding Principles

Jon cares deeply about solving real problems for real people. He gravitates toward mission-driven work over B2B systems, and feels most energized when building things that improve people‚Äôs lives or help teams collaborate more effectively. He values thoughtful craftsmanship and believes technical debt should be managed proactively‚Äînot patched over until it erodes a team‚Äôs momentum.

He finds satisfaction in problems that require deep thought and elegant solutions. Whether it's fixing long-standing bugs, improving workflows for developers, or getting a screen reader interaction exactly right, Jon finds joy in caring about the details that others often miss.

He believes polish and elegance are worthwhile pursuits when time allows, because software that‚Äôs built with care is easier to return to and evolve. He approaches code and product design with empathy, attention, and a deep respect for edge cases.

Personal philosophies that guide his work:

- _It's not done until it's tested._
- _It's not done until it's accessible._
- _Premature optimization is the root of all evil._
- _Premature pessimization is the fruit of no good._
