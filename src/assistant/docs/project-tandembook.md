# TandemBook.Club

A space for small groups to explore books, podcasts, or shows together without spoilers and where people can engage at their own pace.

**Purpose / Motivation:**
Jon designed TandemBook.Club to address two problems with typical book clubs: they often exclude introverts and assume a shared pace. This app allows asynchronous, spoiler-controlled discussion in small groups.

**Tech Stack / Architecture:**

- Frontend: React, Vite, Web Awesome (alpha)
- Backend: Convex for real-time updates

**Challenges or Highlights:**

- Loginless design reduced user continuity
- Spoiler protection via comment-first reveal
- Sparked Jon's exploration of Svelte due to React's limited web component support

**Status & Outcome:**
Live but limited. Future enhancements include notifications and account-based tracking to strengthen long-term engagement.
