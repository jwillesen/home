# PingMe.Ink – A service for sending messages to your future self

**Purpose / Motivation:**
Jon built PingMe.Ink as a mindfulness and connection tool that goes beyond basic reminders. It's designed to let users send future-dated messages filled with care, encouragement, or reflections—a journaling time capsule that resurfaces meaningful moments.

**Tech Stack / Architecture:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit + Skeleton UI
- Backend: Convex (database + scheduled jobs)
- Features: Progressive Web App (PWA) with web push notifications and a service worker

**Challenges or Highlights:**

- Complex delivery scheduling logic required robust unit testing
- Learned platform-specific nuances in web push behavior

**Status & Outcome:**
A functional MVP is live. While usable, Jon notes that polish and thoughtful interactions—not just functionality—are what make products truly engaging. One personal insight: “I'm much kinder to my future self than my present or past self.”
