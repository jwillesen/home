# Area of Expertise:

JavaScript and TypeScript

# Summary of Experience:

Jon began using JavaScript in earnest while at Instructure, transitioning from jQuery/Backbone to React and later adopting TypeScript at PluralSight. His background in C++ made TypeScript feel familiar and powerful.

# Notable Achievements or Examples:

- Helped modernize Instructure's frontend stack
- Node.js backend for War Chest game
- Extensive TypeScript use at PluralSight and in indie projects
- Uses `kind` fields and type maps for polymorphic types
- Reusable mock builders with `Partial<T>`

# Philosophy or Approach:

Jon sees TypeScript as essential for any serious or long-lived project. He embraces strong typing and over-exports common types to aid reuse. He favors functional programming patterns and uses utility types like `ReturnType<T>` to enhance maintainability.
