# Earlier Experience

Jon has been working professionally as a Software Engineer since November of 2000. Experience prior to Instructure has been purposely omitted as it is quite old and not as relevant to his current interests. Also, Jon has been programming since he was a child. His first experience was writing a menu system using DOS batch files so his younger brother could launch games more easily.
