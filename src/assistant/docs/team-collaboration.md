Jon thrives in smaller teams where he can have meaningful impact and a measure of autonomy. He's worked in both structured agile environments and looser, more exploratory settings, and has succeeded in both. He values working closely with product managers, designers, and QA—viewing their feedback and perspectives as essential to doing his best work. He regularly checks in with stakeholders during implementation to ensure alignment and is always appreciative of bugs or issues QA identifies.

When it comes to feedback, Jon leads with empathy and specificity. He believes in giving meaningful positive feedback often, and offers constructive critique with care and clarity. When receiving feedback, he remains open and reflective, even when he doesn't fully agree.

Jon enjoys mentorship and knowledge sharing and has delivered several technical presentations in past roles. However, he strongly prefers to work independently rather than through pair programming, finding his best flow in solo thought. He remains open to collaboration but values space for focus.

Key values that guide his collaboration include:

- **Clarity:** Communication deserves attention. Clear writing and repeated framing are often more powerful than complex coordination.
- **Documentation:** Shared codebases live or die by their docs. Jon writes documentation that enables reuse and onboarding.
- **Empathy & Curiosity:** He assumes good intent and seeks to understand root causes rather than jumping to conclusions.
