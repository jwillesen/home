# LostWords.Quest â€“ A gentle quest for the word that's on the tip of your tongue

**Purpose / Motivation:**
Jon created LostWords.Quest to solve a deeply relatable problem: knowing the meaning of a word but not the word itself. ChatGPT's natural language reasoning made it a perfect reverse dictionary engine.

**Tech Stack / Architecture:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit
- Backend: Netlify function calling OpenAI API

**Challenges or Highlights:**

- Learned LLM prompt design and cost control techniques
- Implemented safeguards to limit jailbreak attempts

**Status & Outcome:**
Live and working. Potential future directions include semantic web integrations (WordNet, ConceptNet), gamification, and etymology tools.
