Outside of work, Jon is an avid board gamer with a special love for strategic yet approachable titles like Concordia and Isle of Cats. He enjoys learning new games, optimizing strategies, and occasionally building digital tools to support gameplay—like his custom Infinite Score Pad app.

Jon is also a speculative fiction fan, particularly of authors like Brandon Sanderson, and regularly reads aloud with his partner. He's deeply interested in AI, storytelling, and the intersection of the two—leading to creative projects like Cozy.Cards, a Tarot-inspired introspection app powered by AI personas.

When he's not coding or writing, Jon enjoys piano improvisation, journaling, and thinking about mental health and emotional resilience. He's passionate about making technology more human, more accessible, and more delightful.
