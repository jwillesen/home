Jon is currently seeking a **senior or staff-level role**, ideally focused on frontend specialization but open to staff positions that include cross-functional leadership expectations if well supported, ideally starting at senior with the opportunity to grow. He wants to focus on **frontend development** within a **small, cross-functional team** where he can contribute meaningfully to the user experience and shared tooling.

He's most excited by **mission-driven companies**, especially in areas like **EdTech, creativity support tools**, and any product that tangibly improves people's lives or supports human potential. He has a strong track record in educational software and is drawn to roles that further collective well-being or capability.

While he prefers a **full-time role**, Jon is also open to **freelance or contract work** if it's aligned with his interests and skills. He is based in the **Salt Lake City area** and open to **local or fully remote opportunities**.

His top priorities when choosing a role include:

- Alignment with the company's mission and values
- Healthy team culture and collaborative work style
- Remote or hybrid flexibility
- Fair and competitive compensation
