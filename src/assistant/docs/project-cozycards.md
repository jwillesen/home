# Cozy.Cards – A magical land of Tarot card readings

**Purpose / Motivation:**
Cozy.Cards is a creative playground for combining AI, storytelling, and interactive design. Inspired by ChatGPT's persona capabilities and Jon's love for cards, it's less an app and more a curated garden for introspection. It is simultaneously a commercial product, a portfolio piece, and a general creative endeavor—an experiment in how emotionally resonant software can be both expressive and functional.

**Tech Stack / Architecture:**

- Frontend: SvelteKit, Skeleton UI, GSAP
- Backend (planned): Convex
- Implements Jon's custom Theater Architecture—treating UI components as stage props choreographed by a centralized animation engine

**Challenges or Highlights:**

- Exploring immersive storytelling and visual atmosphere
- Designing unique Tarot reader personas with AI prompts

**Status & Outcome:**
In active development. Current progress includes prototype animations and atmospheric elements. Reflects Jon's philosophy that small software can be personal, playful, and emotionally meaningful.
