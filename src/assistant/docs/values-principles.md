Jon cares deeply about solving real problems for real people. He gravitates toward mission-driven work over B2B systems, and feels most energized when building things that improve people's lives or help teams collaborate more effectively. He values thoughtful craftsmanship and believes technical debt should be managed proactivelyâ€”not patched over until it erodes a team's momentum.

He finds satisfaction in problems that require deep thought and elegant solutions. Whether it's fixing long-standing bugs, improving workflows for developers, or getting a screen reader interaction exactly right, Jon finds joy in caring about the details that others often miss.

He believes polish and elegance are worthwhile pursuits when time allows, because software that's built with care is easier to return to and evolve. He approaches code and product design with empathy, attention, and a deep respect for edge cases.

Personal philosophies that guide his work:

- _It's not done until it's tested._
- _It's not done until it's accessible._
- _Premature optimization is the root of all evil._
- _Premature pessimization is the fruit of no good._
