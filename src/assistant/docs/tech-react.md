# Area of Expertise: React

## Summary of Experience

Jon has used React extensively since 2015, starting during his time at Instructure where he helped introduce React to the Canvas LMS platform. He has applied React in professional environments across multiple companies and also in personal indie projects. His experience spans versions from 0.13 onward, and he has consistently leveraged React to build complex, performant, and accessible interfaces.

## Notable Achievements or Examples

- Canvas Student Planner (Instructure)
- Grid Optimization (Instructure)
- Tag Taxonomy Tool (PluralSight)
- Greenfield App Foundation (Guaranteed Rate)
- Credential Viewer (Proof)
- TandemBook.Club (Indie)

## Philosophy or Approach:

Jon appreciates React's declarative model and its massive ecosystem, but finds modern versions increasingly heavy and complex—particularly for small-scale apps. He prefers lighter frameworks like Svelte for personal projects. He values composability, clear separation of concerns, and has developed an “Engine Architecture” pattern to separate state and interaction logic from rendering.

## Tools/Technologies Involved:

Vite, Webpack, React Router, Zustand, Styled Components, Apollo GraphQL, ESLint, Prettier, Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library, D3.js, Convex
