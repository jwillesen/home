Jon thrives in small, cross-functional teamsâ€”especially where he can maintain a mix of autonomy and collaboration. While he enjoys the communication bandwidth of in-person work, remote flexibility is important for managing parenting responsibilities and his unique daily rhythm. A hybrid setup might be ideal, but he's proven successful in fully remote and in-office roles alike.

He prefers focused work blocks with minimal interruptions, allowing for deep concentration and creative problem solving. Asynchronous communication styles work well for him when paired with thoughtful documentation and clear goals.

Jon's best fit is in hands-on frontend development, especially when he has ownership over architecture, shared libraries, and UI component design. He values roles where he can build tools that delight both users and fellow engineers, and enjoys mentoring junior developers as part of that process. He is open to leadership roles if they're collaborative and well-supported, but his core passion is thoughtful, impactful building.

What Jon actively avoids:

- **DevOps/SRE roles**: While he respects these disciplines and collaborates well with them, on-call rotations and infrastructure stress are not aligned with his strengths or passions.
- **Backend-only roles**: Jon values full-stack understanding but needs front-end work to feel fulfilled and creatively engaged.
